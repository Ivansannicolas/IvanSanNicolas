# WELCOME TO MY GITHUB!

Hi! I'm Iv√°n, a full stack developer from Barcelona.  


I am very creative and I'm always searching for those little details which make my projects unique!


If you take a look, you will find some of the projects I made while I was in the Skylab's Bootcamp, where I learned from Javascript to React, Redux, and React native, for example, and some of my personal projects. 


Don't be shy!


Feel free to contact if you have some questions or for whatever you like! 
_If you want a hint, I can't say no to a good challenge ^^_
