# Absalom

Welcome to Absalom! My React-Native app for Android and IOS where you can create and manage all kind of characters for your role-playing games, such like D&D, Pathfinder, or any other you like!

Here you can take a look of the actual features the app offers:

### Version 1.0.0

This is the first stable version of Absalom. It's made with React-Native, and uses Redux for the data flow. The backend uses Express, which connects with a Mongodb database.

● Login with your Google account using firebase.

● Create customizable characters with a basic description.

● Take a picture of your character sheet and upload it to have an easy check while you're playing with your friends! If you have your sheet in a pdf, try taking a screenshot. But do't worry, you'll be able to upload your pdf's in the future!

● Create categorys for your equipment with 100% customizable items. Add all the properties you want. Easy and useful!

● Try adding some notes to tell your characters history, the titles they got from their adventures, or just write those little details you don't want to forget.

● Edit your user information to tell other users what games you play, and languages do you speak to make new friends!
