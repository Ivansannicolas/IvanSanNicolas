# Absalom

Welcome to Absalom! My React-Native app for Android and IOS where you can create and manage all kind of characters for your role-playing games, such like D&D, Pathfinder, or any other you like!

Here you can take a look of the actual features the app offers:

### Version 1.0.0

This is the Absalom's first stable version. It's made with React-Native, and uses Redux for the data flow. The backend works with Express, which connects with a Mongodb database.

● Login with your Google account using firebase.

● Create customizable characters with a basic description.

● Take a picture of your character sheet and upload it to have an easy check while you're playing with your friends! If you have your sheet in a pdf, try taking a screenshot. But don't worry, you'll be able to upload your pdf's soon!

●   Create categorys for your equipment and create customizable items with all the properties you want. Easy and useful!

●   Try adding some notes to tell your characters history, the titles they got from their adventures or just write down those little details you don't want to forget.

●   Edit your user information to tell other users the games you play and the languages you speak to make new friends!

●   Working on a search feature to find other users and interact with them.
